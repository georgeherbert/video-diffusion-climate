% The document class supplies options to control rendering of some standard
% features in the result.  The goal is for uniform style, so some attention 
% to detail is *vital* with all fields.  Each field (i.e., text inside the
% curly braces below, so the MEng text inside {MEng} for instance) should 
% take into account the following:
%
% - author name       should be formatted as "FirstName LastName"
%   (not "Initial LastName" for example),
% - supervisor name   should be formatted as "Title FirstName LastName"
%   (where Title is "Dr." or "Prof." for example),
% - degree programme  should be "BSc", "MEng", "MSci", "MSc" or "PhD",
% - dissertation title should be correctly capitalised (plus you can have
%   an optional sub-title if appropriate, or leave this field blank),
% - dissertation type should be formatted as one of the following:
%   * for the MEng degree programme either "enterprise" or "research" to
%     reflect the stream,
%   * for the MSc  degree programme "$X/Y/Z$" for a project deemed to be
%     X%, Y% and Z% of type I, II and III.
% - year              should be formatted as a 4-digit year of submission
%   (so 2014 rather than the academic year, say 2013/14 say).

% The following sections are part of the front matter, but are not generated
% automatically by LaTeX; the use of \chapter* means they are not numbered.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Abstract}

% {\bf A compulsory section, of at most 300 words} 
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
% and main contributions (e.g., deliverables) and achievements; the same 
% section may be called an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the 
% reader is clear about what the topic is, what you have done within this 
% topic, {\em and} what your view of the outcome is.

% The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially 
% this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first 
% chapter. If your project is experimental in nature, this should include 
% a clear research hypothesis.  This will obviously differ significantly
% for each project, but an example might be as follows:

% \begin{quote}
% My research hypothesis is that a suitable genetic algorithm will yield
% more accurate results (when applied to the standard ACME data set) than 
% the algorithm proposed by Jones and Smith, while also executing in less
% time.
% \end{quote}

% \noindent
% The latter aspects should (ideally) be presented as a concise, factual 
% bullet point list.  Again the points will differ for each project, but 
% an might be as follows:

% \begin{quote}
% \noindent
% \begin{itemize}
% \item I spent $120$ hours collecting material on and learning about the 
%       Java garbage-collection sub-system. 
% \item I wrote a total of $5000$ lines of source code, comprising a Linux 
%       device driver for a robot (in C) and a GUI (in Java) that is 
%       used to control it.
% \item I designed a new algorithm for computing the non-linear mapping 
%       from A-space to B-space using a genetic algorithm, see page $17$.
% \item I implemented a version of the algorithm proposed by Jones and 
%       Smith in [6], see page $12$, corrected a mistake in it, and 
%       compared the results with several alternatives.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


\chapter*{Dedication and Acknowledgements}

% {\bf A compulsory section}
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% It is common practice (although totally optional) to acknowledge any
% third-party advice, contribution or influence you have found useful
% during your work.  Examples include support from friends or family, 
% the input of your Supervisor and/or Advisor, external organisations 
% or persons who  have supplied resources of some kind (e.g., funding, 
% advice or time), and so on.


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% This macro creates the standard UoB declaration; on the printed hard-copy,
% this must be physically signed by the author in the space indicated.

\makedecl

% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
% of figures and tables.  These are all compulsory parts of the dissertation.

\tableofcontents

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------



\chapter*{Ethics Statement}

% {\bf A compulsory section} 
% \vspace{1cm} 

% In almost every project, this will be one of the following statements:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item ``This project did not require ethical review, as determined by my supervisor, [fill in name]''; or
%         \item ``This project fits within the scope of ethics application 0026, as reviewed by my supervisor, [fill in name]''; or
%         \item ``An ethics application for this project was reviewed and approved by the faculty research ethics committee as application [fill in number]''.
%     \end{itemize}
    
% See Section 3.2 of the unit Handbook for more information. If something went wrong and none of those three statements apply, then you should instead explain what happened.


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \chapter*{Supporting Technologies}

% {\bf An optional section}
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% This section should present a detailed summary, in bullet point form, 
% of any third-party resources (e.g., hardware and software components) 
% used during the project.  Use of such resources is always perfectly 
% acceptable: the goal of this section is simply to be clear about how
% and where they are used, so that a clear assessment of your work can
% result.  The content can focus on the project topic itself (rather,
% for example, than including ``I used \mbox{\LaTeX} to prepare my 
% dissertation''); an example is as follows:

% \begin{quote}
% \noindent
% \begin{itemize}
% \item I used the Java {\tt BigInteger} class to support my implementation 
%       of RSA.
% \item I used a parts of the OpenCV computer vision library to capture 
%       images from a camera, and for various standard operations (e.g., 
%       threshold, edge detection).
% \item I used an FPGA device supplied by the Department, and altered it 
%       to support an open-source UART core obtained from 
%       \url{http://opencores.org/}.
% \item The web-interface component of my system was implemented by 
%       extending the open-source WordPress software available from
%       \url{http://wordpress.org/}.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Notation and Acronyms}

% {\bf An optional section}
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% Any well written document will introduce notation and acronyms before
% their use, {\em even if} they are standard in some way: this ensures 
% any reader can understand the resulting self-contained content.  

% Said introduction can exist within the dissertation itself, wherever 
% that is appropriate.  For an acronym, this is typically achieved at 
% the first point of use via ``Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)'' or 
% similar, noting the capitalisation of relevant letters.  However, it 
% can be useful to include an additional, dedicated list at the start 
% of the dissertation; the advantage of doing so is that you cannot 
% mistakenly use an acronym before defining it.  A limited example is 
% as follows:

% \begin{quote}
% \noindent
% \begin{tabular}{lcl}
% AES                 &:     & Advanced Encryption Standard                                         \\
% DES                 &:     & Data Encryption Standard                                             \\
%                     &\vdots&                                                                      \\
% ${\mathcal H}( x )$ &:     & the Hamming weight of $x$                                            \\
% ${\mathbb  F}_q$    &:     & a finite field with $q$ elements                                     \\
% $x_i$               &:     & the $i$-th bit of some binary sequence $x$, st. $x_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}$ \\
% \end{tabular}
% \end{quote}


% =============================================================================

% After the front matter comes a number of chapters; under each chapter,
% sections, subsections and even subsubsections are permissible.  The
% pages in this part are numbered with Arabic numerals.  Note that:
%
% - A reference point can be marked using \label{XXX}, and then later
%   referred to via \ref{XXX}; for example Chapter\ref{chap:context}.
% - The chapters are presented here in one file; this can become hard
%   to manage.  An alternative is to save the content in seprate files
%   the use \input{XXX} to import it, which acts like the #include
%   directive in C.

\section{Diffusion Models}
\label{sec:background_diffusion}

Diffusion models are 

Given observed datapoints $\mathbf{x}$, the goal of a generative model is to learn to model its true data distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$.

\subsection{Forward Diffusion Process}
\label{sec:background_diffusion_forward}

The \textit{forward process} is a Gaussian diffusion process that defines a sequence of increasingly noisy versions of $\mathbf{x}$, which we call the \textit{latent variables}:
\begin{align}
      \mathbf{z}=\{\mathbf{z}_t\mid t\in[0,1]\}
\end{align}

The forward process forms a conditional joint distribution $q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})$, whose marginal distributions of latent variables $\mathbf{z}_t$ given $\mathbf{x}\sim p(\mathbf{x})$ are given by:
\begin{align}
      q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{x})=\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{z}_t;\alpha_t\mathbf{x},\sigma_t^2\mathbf{I}\right)
      \label{eq:q_z_t_given_x}
\end{align}
where $\alpha_t$ and $\sigma_t$ are strictly positive scalar-valued functions of $t$.

A notable aspect of the forward process is that the joint distribution of latent variables $\mathbf{z}_r,\mathbf{z}_s,\mathbf{z}_t$ at subsequent timesteps $0\le r < s < t \le 1$ is Markovian:
\begin{align}
      q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{z}_s,\mathbf{z}_r)&=q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{z}_s)=\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{z}_t; \alpha_{t|s}\mathbf{z}_s, \sigma_{t|s}^2\mathbf{I}\right)
\end{align}
where $\alpha_{t|s}=\alpha_t\alpha_s^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{t|s}^2=\sigma_t^2-\alpha_{t|s}^2\sigma_s^2$. A full derivation of $q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{z}_s)$ is given in Appendix \ref{appx:diffusion_q_z_t_given_z_s}.

\subsection{Reverse Generative Model}
\label{sec:background_diffusion_reverse}

The generative model is a learned hierarchical model that matches the forward process running in reverse-time: we sequentially generate latent variables $\mathbf{z}_t$ starting from $t=1$ and working backwards to $t=0$.

Assuming our diffusion model is variance preserving (i.e. $\alpha_t=\sqrt{1-\sigma_t^2}$) and $\alpha_1\approx 0$, we can model the marginal distribution of $\mathbf{z}_1$ as the multivariate standard Gaussian:
\begin{align}
      p(\mathbf{z}_1)\approx\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z}_1;\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})
\end{align}



\subsection{Noise Schedule}
\label{sec:background_diffusion_noise_schedule}

We formalise the notion that $\mathbf{z}_t$ is increasingly noisy by defining a log signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda\in[\lambda_{\min}, \lambda_{\max}]$ as a strictly monotonically decreasing function of time $t\in[0, 1]$.
\begin{align}
      \lambda(t) = \log\left( \frac{\alpha_t^2}{\sigma_t^2}\right)
\end{align}

The \textit{noise schedule} is a critical aspect of the diffusion model. It maps the time variable $t\in[0, 1]$ to a log-signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda\in[\lambda_{\min}, \lambda_{\max}]$.

\section{Climate Simulations}
\label{sec:background_climate}

% =============================================================================

% Finally, after the main matter, the back matter is specified.  This is
% typically populated with just the bibliography.  LaTeX deals with these
% in one of two ways, namely
%
% - inline, which roughly means the author specifies entries using the 
%   \bibitem macro and typesets them manually, or
% - using BiBTeX, which means entries are contained in a separate file
%   (which is essentially a databased) then inported; this is the 
%   approach used below, with the databased being dissertation.bib.
%
% Either way, the each entry has a key (or identifier) which can be used
% in the main matter to cite it, e.g., \cite{X}, \cite[Chapter 2}{Y}.
%
% We would recommend using BiBTeX, since it guarantees a consistent referencing style 
% and since many sites (such as dblp) provide references in BiBTeX format. 
% However, note that by default, BiBTeX will ixwgnore capital letters in article titles 
% to ensure consistency of style. This can lead to e.g. "NP-completeness" becoming
% "np-completeness". To avoid this, make sure any capital letters you want to preserve
% are enclosed in braces in the .bib, e.g. "{NP}-completeness".

\bibliography{dissertation}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The dissertation concludes with a set of (optional) appendicies; these are 
% the same as chapters in a sense, but once signaled as being appendicies via
% the associated macro, LaTeX manages them appropriatly.

\chapter{Diffusion Models}
\label{appx:diffusion}

\section{Derivation of $q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{z}_s)$}
\label{appx:diffusion_q_z_t_given_z_s}

From Equation \ref{eq:q_z_t_given_x}, we know $q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{x})$ is an isotropic Gaussian probability density function. As such, we can sample $\mathbf{z}_t\sim q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{x})$ by sampling $\boldsymbol\epsilon_t\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$ from the multivariate standard Gaussian distribution and computing:
\begin{align}
      \mathbf{z}_t&=\alpha_t\mathbf{x}+\sigma_t\boldsymbol\epsilon_t
\end{align}
With some algebraic manipulation, we can show that:
\begin{align}
      \mathbf{z}_t&=\alpha_t\mathbf{x}+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t\\
      &=\alpha_t\mathbf{x}+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2-\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2+\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t\\
      &=\alpha_t\mathbf{x}+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2-\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2+\left(\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s}\sigma_s\right)^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t
\end{align}
The sum of two independent Gaussian random variables with mean $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ and variance $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $\mu_1+\mu_2$ and variance $\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2$. As such, we can manipulate the above equation further to show that:
\begin{align}
      \mathbf{z}_t&=\alpha_t\mathbf{x}+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2-\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t^*+\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s}\sigma_s\boldsymbol\epsilon_s\\
      &=\alpha_t\mathbf{x}+\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s}\sigma_s\boldsymbol\epsilon_s+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2-\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t^*\\
      &=\frac{\alpha_s}{\alpha_s}\alpha_t\mathbf{x}+\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s}\sigma_s\boldsymbol\epsilon_s+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2-\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t^*\\
      &=\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s}(\alpha_s\mathbf{x}+\sigma_s\boldsymbol\epsilon_s)+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2-\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t^*\\
\end{align}
where $\boldsymbol\epsilon_t^*, \boldsymbol\epsilon_s\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$ are similarly both sampled from the multivariate standard Gaussian distribution. We can substitute $\mathbf{z}_s=\alpha_s\mathbf{x}+\sigma_s\boldsymbol\epsilon_s$ into the above equation to show that:
\begin{align}
      \mathbf{z}_t&=\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s}\mathbf{z}_s+\sqrt{\sigma_t^2-\frac{\alpha_t^2}{\alpha_s^2}\sigma_s^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t^*\\
      &=\alpha_{t|s}\mathbf{z}_s+\sigma_{t|s}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t^*\\
      &\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{z}_t;\alpha_{t|s}\mathbf{z}_s,\sigma_{t|s}^2\mathbf{I}\right)
\end{align}
The subscript $t|s$ relates to the fact that $\alpha_{t|s}$ and $\sigma_{t|s}$ define the parameters of the Gaussian probability density function $q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{z}_s)$.
