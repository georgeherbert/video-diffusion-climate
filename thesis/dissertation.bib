              Hourly precipitation extremes in the Netherlands in eight transient (1951–2099) and five ERA40 driven (1961–2000) regional climate model (RCM) simulations were analyzed. Generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions were fitted to the annual maximum amounts. Large differences were found between the estimated GEV parameters for the RCM simulations and those for an 11-year (1998–2008) high-quality radar data set. There were also large differences between the GEV parameters for different RCM simulations. The influence of the boundary conditions (ERA40 or a global climate model simulation for the present climate) on the extreme value distributions was in most cases small. A similar analysis for the daily precipitation extremes revealed much smaller differences between RCM simulations and a much better agreement with the results for the radar data. The increase in large quantiles of the daily maxima at the end of the 21st century in the transient RCM simulations was much smaller than that in the quantiles of the hourly maxima. For the latter, large differences were found between the changes from different RCM simulations, partly resulting from an increase in the GEV shape parameter in a number of RCM simulations. This increase in the shape parameter also largely explains the differences between the changes in large quantiles of the hourly and daily precipitation extremes.}

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to influence the occurrence and magnitude of rainfall extremes and hence the flood risks in cities. Major impacts of an increased pluvial flood risk are expected to occur at hourly and sub-hourly resolutions. This makes convective storms the dominant rainfall type in relation to urban flooding. The present study focuses on high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) skill in simulating sub-daily rainfall extremes. Temporal and spatial characteristics of output from three different RCM simulations with 25 km resolution are compared to point rainfall extremes estimated from observed data. The applied RCM data sets represent two different models and two different types of forcing. Temporal changes in observed extreme point rainfall are partly reproduced by the RCM RACMO when forced by ERA40 re-analysis data. Two ECHAM forced simulations show similar increases in the occurrence of rainfall extremes of over a 150-year period, but significantly different changes in the magnitudes. The physical processes behind convective rainfall extremes generate a distinctive spatial inter-site correlation structure for extreme events. All analysed RCM rainfall extremes, however, show a clear deviation from this correlation structure for sub-daily rainfalls, partly because RCM output represents areal rainfall intensities and partly due to well-known inadequacies in the convective parameterization of RCMs. The results highlight the problem urban designers are facing when using RCM output. The paper takes the first step towards a methodology by which RCM performance and other downscaling methods can be assessed in relation to the simulation of short-duration rainfall extremes.},

  abstract = {Providing reliable information on climate change at local scale remains a challenge of first importance for impact studies and policymakers. Here, we propose a novel hybrid downscaling method combining the strengths of both empirical statistical downscaling methods and Regional Climate Models (RCMs). In the longer term, the final aim of this tool is to enlarge the high-resolution RCM simulation ensembles at low cost to explore better the various sources of projection uncertainty at local scale. Using a neural network, we build a statistical RCM-emulator by estimating the downscaling function included in the RCM. This framework allows us to learn the relationship between large-scale predictors and a local surface variable of interest over the RCM domain in present and future climate. The RCM-emulator developed in this study is trained to produce daily maps of the near-surface temperature at the RCM resolution (12 km). The emulator demonstrates an excellent ability to reproduce the complex spatial structure and daily variability simulated by the RCM, particularly how the RCM refines the low-resolution climate patterns. Training in future climate appears to be a key feature of our emulator. Moreover, there is a substantial computational benefit of running the emulator rather than the RCM, since training the emulator takes about 2 h on GPU, and the prediction takes less than a minute. However, further work is needed to improve the reproduction of some temperature extremes, the climate change intensity and extend the proposed methodology to different regions, GCMs, RCMs, and variables of interest.},
